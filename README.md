# BCLib
The Latest Version of BCLib can be found here: https://github.com/quiqueck/BCLib/

BCLib is a library mod for BetterX team mods, developed for Fabric, MC 1.18

## Features:
### Rendering
* Emissive textures (with _e suffix)
	* Can be applied to Solid and Transparent blocks;
	* Can be changed/added with resourcepacks;
	* Incompatible with Sodium and Canvas (just will be not rendered);
	* Incompatible with Iris shaders (Iris without shaders works fine).
* Procedural block and item models (from paterns or from code);
* Block render interfaces.

### API:
* Simple Mod Integration API:
  * Get mod inner methods, classes and objects on runtime.
* Structure Features API:
  * Sructure Features with automatical registration, Helpers and math stuff.
* World Data API:
  * World fixers for comfortable migration between mod versions when content was removed;
  * Support for Block name changes and Tile Entities (WIP).
* Bonemeal API:
  * Add custom spreadable blocks;
  * Add custom plants grow with weight, biomes and other checks;
  * Custom underwater plants.
* Features API:
  * Features with automatical registration, Helpers and math.
* Biome API:
  * Biome wrapper around MC biomes;
  * Custom biome data storage;
  * Custom fog density.
* Tag API:
  * Pre-builded set of tags;
  * Dynamical tag registration with code;
  * Adding blocks and items into tags at runtime.

### Libs:
* Spline library (simple):
  * Helper to create simple splines as set of points;
  * Some basic operation with splines;
  * Converting splines to SDF.
* Recipe manager:
  * Register recipes from code with configs and ingredients check.
* Noise library:
  * Voronoi noise and Open Simplex Noise.
* Math library:
  * Many basic math functions that are missing in MC.
* SDF library:
  * Implementation of Signed Distance Functions;
  * Different SDF Operations and Primitives;
  * Different materials for SDF Primitives;
  * Block post-processing;
  * Feature generation using SDF.

### Helpers And Utils:
* Custom surface builders.
* Translation helper:
  * Generates translation template.
* Weighted list:
  * A list of objects by weight;
* Weighted Tree:
  * Fast approach for big weight structures;
* Block helper:
  * Some useful functions to operate with blocks;

### Complex Materials
* Utility classes used for mass content generation (wooden blocks, stone blocks, etc.);
* Contains a set of defined blocks, items, recipes and tags;
* Can be modified before mods startup (will add new block type for all instances in all mods);
* All inner blocks and items are Patterned (will have auto-generated models with ability to override them with resource packs or mod resources).

### Pre-Defined Blocks and Items:
* Most basic blocks from MC;
* Automatic item & block model generation;

### Configs:
* Custom config system based on Json;
* Hierarchical configs;
* Different entry types;
* Only-changes saves.

### Interfaces:
* BlockModelProvider:
  * Allows block to return custom model and blockstate.
* ItemModelProvider:
  * Allows block to return custom item model.
* CustomColorProvider:
  * Make available to add block and item color provider.
* RenderLayerProvider:
  * Determine block render layer (Transparent and Translucent).
* PostInitable:
  * Allows block to init something after all mods are loaded.
* CustomItemProvider:
  * Allows block to change its registered item (example - signs, water lilies).
